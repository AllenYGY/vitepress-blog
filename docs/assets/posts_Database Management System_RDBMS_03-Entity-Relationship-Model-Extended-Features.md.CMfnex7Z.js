Instead of saying “a student is enrolled to a course”, it’s better to say, “a student is enrolled to a section of a course”. Same for instructors, one instructor may teach multiple sections of one course. An entity set “section” is needed. But a section needs to be with a course. Thus, “section” is a weak entity set which depends on “course”. <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/PWsNRI.png" alt="PWsNRI"></p><p>Double rectangles denote weak entity sets. <em>双矩形边框</em> 表示weak entity Dashed underlines denote discriminators of weak entity sets. <em>虚线下划线</em> 表示 weak entity的键 Double diamonds denote identifying relationship sets.

But some constraints are omitted because each entity on the lower-level is one entity on the higher-level (the entity sets on the lower-level always fully participate ISA); one entity cannot be associated with multiple entities in the same entity set on the lower-level. Thus, the constraints on ISA only discuss Does one higher-level entity belong to at least one lower-level entity set? If yes, this ISA is a total generalization. Does one higher-level entity belong to multiple lower-level entity set? If No, it is a disjoint generalization.</p><p>The above design process is bottom-up, combining several entity sets with same attributes into higher-level entity set. But sometimes the process is reversed. Some entity sets can be split into some lower-level entity sets with specific attributes. This top-down process is called specialization.</p><p>Consider the “student” and “instructor” example. If we want to express every person is either a student or an instructor, then this is a total generalization. And if we assume nobody can be a student and an instructor at the same time, this is a disjoint generalization. <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ALLENYGY/ImageSpace@main/uPic/S0PX3U.png" alt="S0PX3U"></p>',14)])])}const u=t(s,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
