Alongside cryptologist Sophie Neveu, Langdon unravels a complex web of codes, symbols, and historical secrets tied to a hidden truth about the Holy Grail and the controversial legacy of Mary Magdalene. The story presents a fictional European secret society, the Priory of Sion, supposedly founded in 1099 and involving famous figures such as Leonardo da Vinci. Another Catholic organization, Opus Dei, emerges in the narrative as a shadowy force, sparking further intrigue. </span></span>

<span class="line"><span>The plot unfolds through a series of cryptic messages and objects, including a keystone believed to lead to the Grail’s hidden location. Langdon and Sophie encounter numerous obstacles, including Silas, a devout albino monk, and Leigh Teabing, a Grail historian with his own hidden motives. As they decode symbols like the pentacle and the number PHI, they chase leads through significant historical sites like Westminster Abbey and Rosslyn Chapel. The story weaves themes of faith, power, and historical mystery, ultimately suggesting a hidden lineage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene that could challenge traditional Christian beliefs.</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="lab-2-character-and-plot-summarization-of-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone" tabindex="-1">Lab-2: Character and Plot Summarization of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> <a class="header-anchor" href="#lab-2-character-and-plot-summarization-of-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-s-stone" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Lab-2: Character and Plot Summarization of _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Lab-2</strong> focused on summarizing <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</em>, identifying key events, characters, and their interactions.

The models tested include:</p><ol><li><strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong></li><li><strong>XGBoost</strong></li><li><strong>Gradient Boosting</strong></li></ol><p>Each of these models has been trained and evaluated using the same dataset to compare their performance. Below is an overview of the steps taken, the rationale behind choosing each model, and the results obtained.</p><h4 id="random-forest-classifier" tabindex="-1">Random Forest Classifier <a class="header-anchor" href="#random-forest-classifier" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Random Forest Classifier&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is particularly effective when dealing with large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces, as it helps to capture complex relationships between the features and the target variable.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: The Random Forest model showed the best performance among the models tested, achieving an <strong>accuracy</strong> of <strong>0.565</strong> and an <strong>AUC</strong> score of <strong>0.5443</strong>. This suggests that the model was effective at capturing the patterns in the data and produced relatively robust results compared to the other models.</li></ul><h4 id="xgboost" tabindex="-1">XGBoost <a class="header-anchor" href="#xgboost" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;XGBoost&quot;">​</a></h4><p>XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm known for its efficiency and performance in structured/tabular data. It builds an ensemble of trees sequentially, where each new tree attempts to correct the errors made by the previous ones. XGBoost is widely used for tasks where predictive performance is critical.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: The XGBoost model achieved an <strong>accuracy</strong> of <strong>0.475</strong> and an <strong>AUC</strong> score of <strong>0.4768</strong>. While it showed reasonable performance, the lower accuracy and AUC indicate that XGBoost was less effective in capturing the complexities of the dataset compared to other models.</li></ul><h4 id="gradient-boosting" tabindex="-1">Gradient Boosting <a class="header-anchor" href="#gradient-boosting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Gradient Boosting&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Gradient Boosting is another ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, optimizing for the loss function. Like XGBoost, it focuses on correcting errors made by earlier models, but it can be more sensitive to hyperparameters and the data itself.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: The Gradient Boosting model achieved an <strong>accuracy</strong> of <strong>0.555</strong> and an <strong>AUC</strong> score of <strong>0.5573</strong>. While it performed better than XGBoost, it still lagged behind Random Forest, suggesting it might require further tuning to optimize its performance on this dataset.</li></ul><p>Based on the comparative analysis of the models, <strong>Random Forest</strong> was chosen as the final model for CTR prediction. The rationale behind this decision includes:</p><p><strong>Robust Performance</strong>: Random Forest demonstrated the best overall performance, with the highest accuracy and AUC score. This indicates that it was able to capture the underlying patterns in the data most effectively. <strong>Reduced Overfitting</strong>: As an ensemble method, Random Forest helps mitigate overfitting, which can be a common issue with individual decision trees. This makes it more reliable in producing accurate predictions on unseen data. <strong>Interpretability and Flexibility</strong>: While Random Forest may not be as interpretable as simpler models, it provides an effective balance between model complexity and prediction accuracy. It also handles high-dimensional datasets well, which is critical in CTR prediction tasks where the feature space can be large and complex.</p><div class="language-python vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">python</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">import</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;"> pandas </span><span style="--shiki-light:#D73A49;--shiki-dark:#F97583;">as</span><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;"> pd</span></span>
